# Introduction to JOIN in MySQL
## A JOIN clause is used in SQL to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. MySQL supports different types of JOINs to retrieve and analyze relational data effectively.

# Types of MySQL JOINs
## 1. INNER JOIN
## 2. LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN)
## 3. RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN)
## 4. FULL OUTER JOIN (Not directly supported in MySQL but can be achieved with a UNION)
## 5. CROSS JOIN
## 6. SELF JOIN
## 7. NATURAL JOIN
